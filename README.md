# facial-landmarks
Finding landmarks on face photos with deep learning.

Dataset used for training: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset  
You can train the neural net by executing facial_landmarks.ipynb. Unfortunately, I could not manage to upload the dataset to google drive and train the net on colab, so I limited training data to 200 images. Use commented indices if you have a good GPU.
